The primary purpose of screening tests is to detect early disease or risk factors for disease in large numbers of apparently healthy individuals. Higher costs associated with diagnostic test maybe justified to establish diagnosis.There now appear to be four main aims of screening, although seven terms are used to describe them: case-finding, mass screening, multiphasic screening, opportunistic screening, periodical health examination, prescriptive screening, and targeted screening."

    "description": "The organisation and contents of laboratories are determined by the differing requirements of the specialists working within. A physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength. A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory, while a psychologist's laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by computer scientists, computers (sometimes supercomputers) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data. Scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories. Engineers use laboratories as well to design, build, and test technological devices."
